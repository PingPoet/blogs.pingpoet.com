	<h4><a id="viewpost_ascx_TitleUrl" title="Title of this entry." href="953.html"> Exploratory, pair-testing experiment </a></h4>
	On Thursday our QA department finished up with an exploratory, pair-testing experiment and found it to be a great success. 
<p>For the past four weeks we took every Thursday and made it an exploratory testing day for a product about to go beta. Our testing department consists of six people (including me) and we typically only have one person responsible for testing a product. Thankfully our department has grown over the past year so we have been able to have some products with two-person teams, but each person is responsible for their own product and we do not test single products as a whole team. Currently we have two new products we are trying to get ready for beta, another we are working on releasing a service pack for, and a fourth we are beginning first phase testing on. Because of the situation with the service pack and the relation of the two new products, it was actually an opportune time to attempt this type of team-testing experiment. 
</p><p>One of the reasons I decided to try the experiment was because I noticed when we started testing and learning the new product there were a lot of little bugs that were really annoying people. At the same time these bugs did not prevent people from actually getting an end result so they were not making their way into the bug tracking system. Clearly there were issues with the product when we first got it, but the bug count was not reflecting these problems. The conclusion I came to was that we were focusing on an end result, usually trying to complete tests from the test guide, and not taking the time to really report all the small bugs that we came across while getting the end result we expected. We were also running short on time, so I decided I would give pair-testing a try and I asked everyone in QA to set aside Thursdays to do exploratory testing with a second person. The reason I choose to do two people was mainly to speed up the process so one person could test the product while the other one entered the bugs, and then switch roles in the afternoon. Having two people actually had other benefits and seemed to make the whole experience more enjoyable –as was apparent from the laughter (no mal intent). 
</p><p>The first test day was pretty much open season on the product. Since a lot of the team members had not used the product before I figure a lot of time would be spent really learning how the product works, so I didn’t want to guide their test focus. I figured the teams would be running into all the little bugs as they learned the product, which we did, and get them reported, which we did. I assigned the team members based on their relationships to their other product responsibilities. The support manager allowed us to borrow an upper level support person as well which rounded out the teams to three groups of two (I participated but was not grouped with anyone). I was really surprised by the excellent results of the first day and it appeared from the commotion in the different offices that people were having fun (if the developers were around they probably wouldn’t have been having as much fun). After the first day the test lead assigned general areas for each team to focus on during the remaining three test days and the number of issues we were able to report was exceptional. 
</p><p>After seeing the number of issues reported on the first day one of my concerns was that the test suite for the product would end up not including a lot of these cases so I asked the lead to make sure they verified all the fixed issues and updated their test suite accordingly. Typically for all of our other products it has been the responsibility of the person who entered the bug report to verify and close the issue, so this was a departure from the normal procedure - but I felt it was needed. 
</p><p>So what kind of results did we see after four exploratory testing days? We managed to submit 281 potential bugs, some of which ended up being duplicates and “as designed” issues, as a group (roughly 40 per person) and the end result was a product that felt a lot more stable than when we began. The results were a lot better than I expected. 
</p><p>Fortunately there were special circumstances that enabled us to try this and it proved to be a successful experiment. I have indicated to my team that in the future we may do this again, but it will probably not be something we are able to do for every new product we are testing. After we finished the experiment I asked my team to provide some feedback on how they felt the endeavor went and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. One of the newer testers indicated they were able to learn a lot more about how to look for bugs so it was very helpful for them. A couple others indicated it was a good experience because they could talk about the issues they were running up against and discuss whether or not they felt it was a bug, as well as feed off of each other to come up with new things to do to try to break the product. A couple of suggestions that came out of the responses were to consider switching up the team members each day so they could learn from each other’s different approaches and to maybe have a day where instead of just testing these general areas we would focus on specific use case type scenarios. 
</p><p>I really appreciate the effort my team put forth with this and appreciate being able to use one of our support staff members. I feel this was very beneficial not only to the teams but for the product as well.
