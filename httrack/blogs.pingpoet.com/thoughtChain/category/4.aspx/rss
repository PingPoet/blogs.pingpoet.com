            <title>Mono and Mozilla - Powerful Duo</title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2006/02/14/18898.aspx</link>
            <description>Zac Bowling has  a post about JavaScript 2.0 [ http://zacbowling.com/blog/2006/02/13/just-cuz/ ] 
In it he makes a powerful comment "Embedding mono into mozilla might be a solution worth looking into."   I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately and I think it is something that both the mozilla and mono teams should pursue immediately.  Mozilla has created a great multi-platform infrastructure that's taking the web by storm.  However, the low level programming is not main-stream because it's C++ and the high-level XUL+JScript is not powerful enough.  

Adding mono into the mix would give XUL a set of compiled languages, multi-platform runtime and a huge set of usable class libraries.   This mix would be a great answer to XAML.  This would be the ultimate solution for true multiplatform applications that use the web infrastructure (NOT THE BROWSER) sensibly and deliver fast and rich client experience.   I am not a huge fan of using the browser for web applications, i see the whole ASP.NET Atlas and AJAX in general as patches that try to make the browser into something it was never meant to do.  XUL was a step in the right direction but it needs a lot more support from professional programming languages and environments.&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/18898.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>Update and VS2k5 Installed</title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2005/10/29/13409.aspx</link>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;wow! it's a been such a long time since I blogged.&amp;nbsp; Part of it is beging extremely busy and the other being extremely lazy :)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, I just finished downloading RTM images of&amp;nbsp;VS2k5 and SS2k5.&amp;nbsp; In preparation for this I had upgraded my laptop (Toshiba Portege M200) to 2GB RAM and 120GB Hard drive.&amp;nbsp; I scrubbed it clean, installed WinXP Pro, the bare essentials (Edit Plus, Total Commander, Process Explorer, Zoom+, NetCaptor, FeedDemon).&amp;nbsp; Then I installed VMWare Workstation.&amp;nbsp; I allocated 60GB partition for Virtual Machines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I created a base VM with WinXP pro and the latest windows updates, I had it set up with 1GB RAM and 30GB virtual hard disk.&amp;nbsp; Then I started spawning new VMs from this.&amp;nbsp; I created a clone called junk: stays clean and is used for experiments and testing install scripts on a clean machine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I created another for Office2k3 and VS2k3, this is my main dev VM.&amp;nbsp; I cloned that one too, for junk expriments.&amp;nbsp; Now that I downloaded VS2k5 i cloned the base and installed O2k3 + VS2k5 + SS2k5 to create my new 2k5 dev VM.&amp;nbsp; Everything went very smoothly and the VMs are fast enough for development.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I have a common HD partition called Stuff where I keep all my data files (outlook, OneNote, ...) all VMs have access to this partition through &lt;STRONG&gt;shared folders&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; So whichever VM i am using i can access my email, notes and files.&amp;nbsp; In addition, i used TweakUI to redirect the Shell Folders from the OS VM hard drive to this common partition so anything i save to &amp;#8220;My Documents&amp;#8220; ends up shared for all VMs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now I have 10 VMs for a variety of purposes.&amp;nbsp; Demo VMs (VS6, VS2k3 and VS2k5).&amp;nbsp; Dev VMs (same), Junk (same) and base.&amp;nbsp; This will hopefully keep things clean and organized.&amp;nbsp; I hate running different versions of VS / SS on the same machine, this allows me to completely isolate everything without having to reboot my machine to switch partitions.&amp;nbsp; I can also play around with new software without impacting my main dev VMs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Why not use Virtual PC instead?&amp;nbsp; No reason really, i just like VMWare and have been using it for a while.&amp;nbsp; Everyone else at the office uses Virtual PC and they like it.&amp;nbsp; The same process can be followed with either of these products.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/13409.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>ActiveReports Trouble - We're here to help </title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2005/06/12/2857.aspx</link>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mjc2103/70028.html"&gt;MJC cannot figure out&lt;/A&gt; how to merge multiple reports, so he's frustrated it with it.&amp;nbsp; It's actually simple, run the individual reports, then merge their page collections into a single report.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;rpt1.Run();&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;rpt2.Run();&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;foreach(Page pg in rpt2.Document.Pages)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;{&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;rpt1.Document.Pages.Insert(pg);&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;}&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;// now rpt1 is a merged report of rpt1 and rpt2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/2857.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>Latest Spam Attack</title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2005/06/12/2856.aspx</link>
            <description>&lt;A href="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/overflow"&gt;Scott&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;recently added CAPTCHA to pingpoet blogs to reduce comment spam.&amp;nbsp; However, today I noticed that I got a ton of Pingback spam.&amp;nbsp; My guess is that some automated tool is subscribed to my feed and it automatically creates pingbacks to all my posts.&amp;nbsp; Took me forever to delete all the SPAM entries.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .Text delete operation is the worst I've seen, it does not allow multiple selection and requires two confirmations, that's three page refreshes to delete a single entry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/2856.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>TechEd: Off to a bad start</title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2005/06/06/2454.aspx</link>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Got here last night, hotel (Sheraton Studio City) is OK but not on the conference shuttle list.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the crew coming in from Columbus, OH&amp;nbsp;got stuck in Atlanta all night.&amp;nbsp; They had to take a flight to Tampa this morning and drive from there to Orlando.&amp;nbsp; Of course that meant I had to get up at 7:30am set up the booth all by myself.&amp;nbsp; That sucked!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For those who know me, getting up at 7:30am&amp;nbsp;WAS the hard part :)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, with little help from a friend at /n Software I was able to put it together.&amp;nbsp; Now I am waiting for the crew to get here, hopefully before the exhibit hall opens at noon.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;TechEd is sold out this year, so it will be very busy.&amp;nbsp; I can see the crowds in the halls and outside the Orlando convention center.&amp;nbsp; WiFi is available everywhere but it is very slow.&amp;nbsp; I can barely get my email.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/2454.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>ActiveReports has a new fan :)</title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2005/05/31/2445.aspx</link>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://blog.thedrebin.com/drebin/archive/2005/05/31/209.aspx"&gt;&amp;#8220;the Drebin&amp;#8221; likes &lt;a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com" &gt;ActiveReports&lt;/a&gt; 2.0&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp; however, he has a couple of pet peeves&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;1. Licensing:&amp;nbsp;i saw the email go through the internal list today and hopefully our excellent support crew will help him resolve the licensing issue.&amp;nbsp; Many of the these licensing issues have to do with how the licenses file works in VS.&amp;nbsp; I find the most helpful hint is to add a new report to the project and that helps recreate the licenses file with the new registered key and the rest of the reports get registered.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;2. Control Copy/Paste: As far as pasting a control, we followed what MSAccess does, when pasting using the keyboard we default to 0,0 because keeping the original coords would put the control on top of its original copy confusuing users.&amp;nbsp; However, pasting using the mouse (context menu) places the new control at the mouse coordinates.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;3. re: the .Text property, part of this has to do with the property grid in VS, we had a feature in 2.0 list to add a simple multi-line string type editor for the text property, I'll have to check and see what happened with that.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, I am glad &amp;#8220;the Derbin&amp;#8221; likes &lt;a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com" &gt;ActiveReports&lt;/a&gt;, i get asked a lot, why should one buy &lt;a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com" &gt;ActiveReports&lt;/a&gt; when CR is or RS is &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; And my answer is always, first, they are not free, second, give it a try and be the judge, download the eval and try a couple of reports and make sure it works for you before you commit to anything.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com" &gt;ActiveReports&lt;/a&gt; is a report designer by developers for developers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/2445.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>WinFX SDK for VS Beta 2 Released</title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2005/05/22/2001.aspx</link>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;I just downloaded the new &lt;A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=90&amp;amp;p=&amp;amp;SrcDisplayLang=en&amp;amp;SrcCategoryId=&amp;amp;SrcFamilyId=b789bc8d-4f25-4823-b6aa-c5edf432d0c1&amp;amp;genscs=0&amp;amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fdownload.microsoft.com%2fdownload%2ff%2fa%2f3%2ffa3b19ba-6129-41e8-93d8-498cc6b52b14%2fwinfxsetup.exe"&gt;WinFX SDK for VS Beta 2&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I will install it tonight and start reviewing the changes.&amp;nbsp; I've been spending quite some time with WinFX lately and it is exciting and daunting at the same time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is remarkable the amount of work that went into it.&amp;nbsp; However, IMHO they've exposed quite a bit of useless stuff (from a business apps point of view)&amp;nbsp; The whole animation namespace and the 3D stuff is nice and everything but applies to select few graphics specialists.&amp;nbsp; I honestly don't see how businesses will benefit from these two features.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The good thing is that they also did an awesome job on the text formatting and document namespaces, I've always thought that's an area where WinSDK was very lacking.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Anyway, I'll be digging in over the next couple of months trying to wrap my head around all this stuff.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/2001.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>Crystal Reports bug bites Chris Wallace</title>

            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://tamasii.com/blog/archive/2005/05/19/48985.aspx"&gt;Another Reason Crystal Reports Sucks&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That's one thing that we avoid doing in &lt;A href="http://www.datadynamics.com"&gt;&lt;a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com" &gt;ActiveReports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We leave database handling to the developer and simply pass the connection string and sql to the provider.&amp;nbsp; We trust that our users know what they're doing and can talk to their database however they want.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/1959.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>

            <title>Google's Web Accelerator Flaw and Web Applications</title>
            <link>http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/archive/2005/05/09/1831.aspx</link>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Recently Google released Web Accelerator add-on that prefetches pages based on links in the page you're viewing.&amp;nbsp; This might work well in news site or something, but in a browser web application it had a negative effect.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A link might be to some application function that should not be fetched automatically such as &amp;#8220;Add Record&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Delete&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; I know it's not completely Google's fault and that there are proper ways of writing&amp;nbsp;code instead of a simple hyperlink to avoid this.&amp;nbsp; But the fact is many web apps are written that way and it back-fired with Google's add-on.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I think this is really a fundemantal flaw in using the browser for writing web applications.&amp;nbsp; The browser never made sense to me as a web application host, as a developer you spend more time fighting the platform(s) than focusing on your own application logic.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Here at &lt;A href="http://www.datadynamics.com"&gt;Data Dynamics&lt;/A&gt; we're working on something that we hope will fix that.&amp;nbsp; It is very top secret now.&amp;nbsp; However, rest assured that I will have a lot more to say about it in few months :)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.pingpoet.com/thoughtChain/aggbug/1831.aspx" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</description>
