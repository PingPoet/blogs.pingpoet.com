			Zac Bowling has  a post about JavaScript 2.0 [ http://zacbowling.com/blog/2006/02/13/just-cuz/ ] 
In it he makes a powerful comment "Embedding mono into mozilla might be a solution worth looking into."   I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately and I think it is something that both the mozilla and mono teams should pursue immediately.  Mozilla has created a great multi-platform infrastructure that's taking the web by storm.  However, the low level programming is not main-stream because it's C++ and the high-level XUL+JScript is not powerful enough.  

Adding mono into the mix would give XUL a set of compiled languages, multi-platform runtime and a huge set of usable class libraries.   This mix would be a great answer to XAML.  This would be the ultimate solution for true multiplatform applications that use the web infrastructure (NOT THE BROWSER) sensibly and deliver fast and rich client experience.   I am not a huge fan of using the browser for web applications, i see the whole ASP.NET Atlas and AJAX in general as patches that try to make the browser into something it was never meant to do.  XUL was a step in the right direction but it needs a lot more support from professional programming languages and environments.

			<P>wow! it's a been such a long time since I blogged.&nbsp; Part of it is beging extremely busy and the other being extremely lazy :)&nbsp; </P>
<P>Anyway, I just finished downloading RTM images of&nbsp;VS2k5 and SS2k5.&nbsp; In preparation for this I had upgraded my laptop (Toshiba Portege M200) to 2GB RAM and 120GB Hard drive.&nbsp; I scrubbed it clean, installed WinXP Pro, the bare essentials (Edit Plus, Total Commander, Process Explorer, Zoom+, NetCaptor, FeedDemon).&nbsp; Then I installed VMWare Workstation.&nbsp; I allocated 60GB partition for Virtual Machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; I created a base VM with WinXP pro and the latest windows updates, I had it set up with 1GB RAM and 30GB virtual hard disk.&nbsp; Then I started spawning new VMs from this.&nbsp; I created a clone called junk: stays clean and is used for experiments and testing install scripts on a clean machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I created another for Office2k3 and VS2k3, this is my main dev VM.&nbsp; I cloned that one too, for junk expriments.&nbsp; Now that I downloaded VS2k5 i cloned the base and installed O2k3 + VS2k5 + SS2k5 to create my new 2k5 dev VM.&nbsp; Everything went very smoothly and the VMs are fast enough for development.</P>
<P>I have a common HD partition called Stuff where I keep all my data files (outlook, OneNote, ...) all VMs have access to this partition through <STRONG>shared folders</STRONG>.&nbsp; So whichever VM i am using i can access my email, notes and files.&nbsp; In addition, i used TweakUI to redirect the Shell Folders from the OS VM hard drive to this common partition so anything i save to &#8220;My Documents&#8220; ends up shared for all VMs.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now I have 10 VMs for a variety of purposes.&nbsp; Demo VMs (VS6, VS2k3 and VS2k5).&nbsp; Dev VMs (same), Junk (same) and base.&nbsp; This will hopefully keep things clean and organized.&nbsp; I hate running different versions of VS / SS on the same machine, this allows me to completely isolate everything without having to reboot my machine to switch partitions.&nbsp; I can also play around with new software without impacting my main dev VMs.</P>
<P>Why not use Virtual PC instead?&nbsp; No reason really, i just like VMWare and have been using it for a while.&nbsp; Everyone else at the office uses Virtual PC and they like it.&nbsp; The same process can be followed with either of these products.</P>

			<A href="../overflow/index.html">Scott</A>&nbsp;recently added CAPTCHA to pingpoet blogs to reduce comment spam.&nbsp; However, today I noticed that I got a ton of Pingback spam.&nbsp; My guess is that some automated tool is subscribed to my feed and it automatically creates pingbacks to all my posts.&nbsp; Took me forever to delete all the SPAM entries.&nbsp;&nbsp; .Text delete operation is the worst I've seen, it does not allow multiple selection and requires two confirmations, that's three page refreshes to delete a single entry.&nbsp;

			<P>Got here last night, hotel (Sheraton Studio City) is OK but not on the conference shuttle list.&nbsp; The rest of the crew coming in from Columbus, OH&nbsp;got stuck in Atlanta all night.&nbsp; They had to take a flight to Tampa this morning and drive from there to Orlando.&nbsp; Of course that meant I had to get up at 7:30am set up the booth all by myself.&nbsp; That sucked!&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who know me, getting up at 7:30am&nbsp;WAS the hard part :)</P>
<P>Anyway, with little help from a friend at /n Software I was able to put it together.&nbsp; Now I am waiting for the crew to get here, hopefully before the exhibit hall opens at noon.</P>
<P>TechEd is sold out this year, so it will be very busy.&nbsp; I can see the crowds in the halls and outside the Orlando convention center.&nbsp; WiFi is available everywhere but it is very slow.&nbsp; I can barely get my email.</P>

			<P><A href="http://blog.thedrebin.com/drebin/archive/2005/05/31/209.aspx">&#8220;the Drebin&#8221; likes <a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com/" >ActiveReports</a> 2.0</A>&nbsp; however, he has a couple of pet peeves</P>
<P>1. Licensing:&nbsp;i saw the email go through the internal list today and hopefully our excellent support crew will help him resolve the licensing issue.&nbsp; Many of the these licensing issues have to do with how the licenses file works in VS.&nbsp; I find the most helpful hint is to add a new report to the project and that helps recreate the licenses file with the new registered key and the rest of the reports get registered.</P>
<P>2. Control Copy/Paste: As far as pasting a control, we followed what MSAccess does, when pasting using the keyboard we default to 0,0 because keeping the original coords would put the control on top of its original copy confusuing users.&nbsp; However, pasting using the mouse (context menu) places the new control at the mouse coordinates.</P>
<P>3. re: the .Text property, part of this has to do with the property grid in VS, we had a feature in 2.0 list to add a simple multi-line string type editor for the text property, I'll have to check and see what happened with that.</P>
<P>Anyway, I am glad &#8220;the Derbin&#8221; likes <a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com/" >ActiveReports</a>, i get asked a lot, why should one buy <a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com/" >ActiveReports</a> when CR is or RS is &#8220;free&#8221;.&nbsp; And my answer is always, first, they are not free, second, give it a try and be the judge, download the eval and try a couple of reports and make sure it works for you before you commit to anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com/" >ActiveReports</a> is a report designer by developers for developers.</P>

<P>My feeling is that this made the first two worth it, it tied everything together nicely.&nbsp; CG was incredible as usual.&nbsp; This will definately set a new standard for everyone else to follow.&nbsp; </P>

			<P>Recently Google released Web Accelerator add-on that prefetches pages based on links in the page you're viewing.&nbsp; This might work well in news site or something, but in a browser web application it had a negative effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;A link might be to some application function that should not be fetched automatically such as &#8220;Add Record&#8221; or &#8220;Delete&#8221;.&nbsp; I know it's not completely Google's fault and that there are proper ways of writing&nbsp;code instead of a simple hyperlink to avoid this.&nbsp; But the fact is many web apps are written that way and it back-fired with Google's add-on.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>I think this is really a fundemantal flaw in using the browser for writing web applications.&nbsp; The browser never made sense to me as a web application host, as a developer you spend more time fighting the platform(s) than focusing on your own application logic.</P>
<P>Here at <A href="http://www.datadynamics.com/">Data Dynamics</A> we're working on something that we hope will fix that.&nbsp; It is very top secret now.&nbsp; However, rest assured that I will have a lot more to say about it in few months :)</P>

			<P>Brendan Tompkins <A href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/brendan.tompkins/archive/2005/05/05/62812.aspx">posted a candid&nbsp;interview</A> with a Crystal Reports guru.</P>
<P>Interesting insight into Business Objects strategy &#8220;Keep up with Cognos&#8221;&nbsp; and their VS integrated product &#8220;It wasn't designed to be scalable&#8221; </P>
<P>I guess Crystal is not focused on developers and it shows in their recent releases.&nbsp; We created <A href="http://www.datadynamics.com/"><a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com/" >ActiveReports</a></A> specifically because CR ignored developers and it seems they only wanted to use them as a stepping stone into the Enterprise market.&nbsp; They've always wanted to play with BO, Cognos, Microstrategy.&nbsp; I guess they got their wish :)&nbsp; It amazes me that they are still considered a developer tool vendor.</P>

			<P>I travel quite a bit and I enjoy watching the MSDN and Technet <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/webcasts/ondemand.mspx">webcasts</A> on the plane and at airports during long trips.&nbsp; MS has been great in offering such a wealth of information on their web sites.&nbsp; <STRONG>However</STRONG>, the download process for offline viewing really sucks.&nbsp; I have to login using passport, register a couple of times before I can start the download.&nbsp; And, here is the rub, I have to do this every time for every webcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; This sucks!&nbsp; Why can't they just put the downloads in a simple list where I login once and it remembers who I am and allow me to download all that I need at once.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why jump through all these hoops to get something that they want us to download.</P>
<P>anyone else has similar issues with this?</P>

			<P>I've been silent lately because I am swamped with two major releases and starting two new projects.&nbsp; I cannot say anything about the new project except that they are VERY exciting :), so I'll mention the new releases..</P>
<P>Tomorrow (Friday April 15th) we release a major upgrade to <a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com/" >ActiveReports</a> for .NET and add a new product to our line.&nbsp; Both products have been long in development, qa and documentation.&nbsp; We've put a lot of effort to correct many issues with <a title="" href="http://www.datadynamics.com/" >ActiveReports</a>, this version is the most tested version we ever had.&nbsp; And we added a Chart control, made pdf vector image quality much better with EMF support and added IList data binding - a frequently requested feature-.</P>
<P>SharpGraph is a new product that will prove very competitive with existing charts on the market.&nbsp; I have big plans for this one :)&nbsp; This initial release is just to get us started, it supported all the popular chart types and has extensive styling options to make charts look awesome.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Make sure you download your evaluation copies from our web site - <A href="http://www.datadynamics.com/">www.datadynamics.com</A></P>

<P>To my shock or horror, I get to Chapter 9, pages 282-285 and&nbsp;they detail an eye witness account - by Terry Anderson, the AP reporter and hostage in lebanon for a number of years- of the death of three second cousins of mine during the 1982 Israeli invasion.&nbsp; I had heard of their death - I have not lived in Beirut since 1979- at the time, but it was horrific to read about how they died.&nbsp; He describes the death of Ahmad Baitam 3 year old from resporitory failure caused by phosphorus burns in his lungs.&nbsp; His two five-day old twin brothers and 4.5 year old brother&nbsp;died of similar wounds the day before.&nbsp; The&nbsp;doctor treating them&nbsp;said: &#8220;I had to take the babies and put them in buckets of water to put out the flames, when i took them half an hour later they were still burning.&nbsp; Even in the motuary, they smoldered for hours".&nbsp; When they took them the next morning for burial they again burst into flames.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Phosphorus artillary was first used in WWI, the phosphorus smoke lingers and causes internal burns that continue to smolder and are almost impossible to treat once it gets into the lungs.</P>

When I tried to explain that there were a lot of innocent people in Iraq, he told me that they were all terrorists and that that is what they get for attacking us on September 11th. </blockquote><blockquote>Also my Aunt is a proud Bush supporter (Ohio) because he is liberating Iraq from the Communists. </blockquote><p>Whoa!</p><p>Overall, I think this election was for the democrats to loose.&nbsp; I voted for Nader because I did not think the democrats offered a good alternative.&nbsp; They need to reflect and focus their message to gain support in one of the close states, I think their best bet is in the southwest and possibly one of the close ones in the mid-west.&nbsp; The south is most-likely lost forever.&nbsp; The northeast and west elite democrats will never reach people in the south.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>In <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/nader10162004.html">his letter</a>&nbsp;Ralph tells the story of an Israeli pilot who refused to contribute to the killing of Palestinian civilians.&nbsp; This quote is very telling of the views and policies of the IDF.</p><blockquote>In the discussion of my dismissal, I asked General Halutz if he would allow the firing of missiles from an Apache helicopter on a car carrying wanted men, if it were traveling in the streets of Tel Aviv, in the knowledge that that action would hurt innocent civilians who happened to be passing at the time. In answer, the general gave me his list of relative values of people, as he sees it, from the Jewish person who is superior down to the blood of an Arab which is inferior. As simple as that.</blockquote><p>In <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/bytopic/219.shtml">Palestine</a> and in <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/">Iraq</a> thousands of civilians have died, they are never officially counted and are referred to as "Collateral Damage".&nbsp; They are not counted because they don't matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

			<P>Hi, my name is Issam, and I am a political junkie.&nbsp;&nbsp; This election season is a great opportunity for me to feed my addiction.</P>
<P>I just watched the VP debate and the pundits commentaries that followed.&nbsp; It was amazing how the pundits saw the debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most saw Dick Cheney as the victor and all I saw is continued evasiveness and absurd logic when responding to questions about Iraq.&nbsp; I thought that Edwards at the very least stood his grounds against the VP and I think the average American believed him more than they did Cheney.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I checked the instant polls on all news sites (CNN, CBS, fox, msnbc) and it seems that many people share my opinion in declaring Edwards as the winner despite what the pundits say.</P>

			<a href="http://west-wind.com/weblog/posts/879.aspx">Rick Strahl summarizes my discussion with him on XmlDocs in source vs repository</a>. &nbsp;<br /><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I wanted to clarify&nbsp;few things about how we (at <a href="http://www.datadynamics.com/">DataDynamics</a>) develop and document our components.&nbsp; </font></p><ul><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">We typically have a team of 2-3 developers working on different parts of the project.</div></li><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Developers are not necessarily in the same location and they would not be connected to our network all the time, they check out the code they're working on and code away whether they are at the office, at home or traveling.&nbsp; They connect back to the network to check in their code (and documentation) into StarTeam.</div></li><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Developers are required to document the headers of public types and members using xml documentation standards introduced by the C# compiler.&nbsp; The C# compiler generates warnings in our release build if we're missing any documentation.&nbsp; And it generates the XML files required for intellisense in VS.NET.</div></li><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The XMLDocs compiler checks are great, however, the format and location of the comments are a mess.&nbsp; The documentation written by developers has to be edited by our documentation personnel.&nbsp; They do not have -and shouldn't have- access to our source code repository.</div></li><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">XMLDocs has a special tag that allows storing the comments in a separate file.&nbsp; &lt;include&gt;.&nbsp; The format of the file is open and it can be any xml that produces valid content from an XPath expression.&nbsp; We chose to create an .xmldoc file for each source file.&nbsp; Each node the xmldoc file would represent a type or a member in our source code file.&nbsp; Think of it like pairing the cs/resx in the case of winforms.</div></li><ul><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Rick's example is different from how we write our files, we do not keep a node for the project because some of our files can be used in multiple projects.&nbsp; Also, we do not&nbsp;have a node for the namespace either.&nbsp; Each node has a unique id that is "namespace.type.member"&nbsp; if the member is overloaded we simply add a #1..n at the end.&nbsp; The xpath would be <a href="mailto:'@name=&quot;namespace.type.member#1..n&quot;">'@name="namespace.type.member#1..n"</a></div></li></ul><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Keeping the xml content in separate files allows us to work with it just like we do with the code, write it in a distributed independent fashion, version it, and control access to the source code repository.</div></li><li><div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Once our developers have completed their part of code/doc, our documentation persons edit the documenation before we generate the assemblies/intellisense xml.&nbsp;&nbsp;

			[via: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/archive/2004/09/08/227135.aspx">Michael Swanson's Blog</a>] <br /><br />I had planned to post my own article about slipstreaming the recently released Service Pack 2 with your original Windows XP CD media, but it looks like Tom's Hardware beat me to it. By following the instructions in <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040908/index.html">the article</a>, you can create a single bootable CD that installs Windows XP along with Service Pack 2. If you're like me and you like to refresh and reinstall your system every six months or so, having a CD like this is very handy. Here's <a href="http://www.windows-help.net/WindowsXP/winxp-sp2-bootcd.html">another article with similar instructions</a>.

			<P>As I mentioned before I have a TiVo and I love it.&nbsp; I just bought a portable media player AV340 from Archos (<A href="http://www.archos.com/">www.archos.com</A>) -they have a newer model now, even cooler.&nbsp; Anyway, I use TiVo to record shows then use the Save to VCR function to move the content to the AV340.&nbsp; This sucks, because it takes a long time, i have to play all the recorded shows one by one and rename the files on the AV340.&nbsp; TiVo needs to get it's act together and create the ultimate PVR, here is a wish list.</P>
<P>- Allow access to Tivo drive from my home network&nbsp;OR recognize external hard-drives connected through USB and allow copying content to them.&nbsp; I should be able to encode and compress the content with DivX.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or if that's an issue,&nbsp;team up with Archos and get this to work, it is brilliant.&nbsp; MS is doing this with Creative and iRiver.</P>
<P>- 2 Tuners in a TiVo and PiP (picture-in-picture) support.</P>
<P>- Coordinate multiple TiVos in the house so I can record conflicting shows.</P>
<P>- Why the heck should I need a cable box, can they put something in to get rid of that.</P>
<P>- A TiVo server and mini Players: I would love to have an expandable multi-hard-drive, multi-tuner Kick-Ass TiVo server in the house and I can access it from any number of smaller access points (mini-TiVo).&nbsp; </P>
<P>- Open up the SDK so I can add home-automation, caller-id,&nbsp;IM, weather,&nbsp;RSS, email, and whatever the heck I want to that server.</P>
<P>TiVo can own the digital home entertainment&nbsp;if they make their box and software more expandable.&nbsp; I spent $500 on TiVo and would be glad to spend a lot more if they create a platform that they and others can build on.</P>
